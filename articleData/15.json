    "detail": "So Cobe has always appeared to be analytical, it may not be his character going forward in life but for now, he certainly likes to order things., count them, be aware when things have changes sequence etc.\n\nTonight however, I was simply astounded to find that the puzzles he's been playing with for some time now he has managed to completely solve. He's identifying the patterns on the sides of the pieces and matching them up to patterns on the sides of others. There's three puzzles he's got that he's now able to solve, all of increasing complexity.\n\nIt's so humbling watching him grow and learn like this, often without prompt or direct guidance. He's naturally finding the solution and feeling confident with the solution as he solves problems with it!\n\nOne proud Dad"
