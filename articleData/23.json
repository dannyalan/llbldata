    "detail": "With spring arriving, I've been aware that our cacti collection isn't quite in ship shape ready for the summer's feed.\n\nThis afternoon, Cobe and I started to tackle this by repotting them all. We've got some stones for the bottom of the pots, new potting mix, stones for the top of the newly potted plant, and of course, the cacti.\n\nCobe's jobs started with putting stones in the bottom of the pots, then once the cactus has had it's roots exposed, we both placed it in the pot and put in the new potting mix. Finally, Cobe's favourite job; putting the nice stones on the top.\n\nGreat job Cobe."
