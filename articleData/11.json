    "detail": "For some time, I have had somewhat of a collection of cacti and succulents in the house. I guess it's my way of making the home feel a little outdoorsy and and getting some additional clean air in the house for my family to breathe. Plus, they're kinda cool tool, with so many species available.\n\nCobe has however, always loved the cacti too, and as such, when I found a tiny one in a shop, I decided to get it for him and he duly named it Curt. Curt however, along with the rest of most of the collection were up out of reach to prevent prickles getting Cobe's tiny fingers.\n\nRecently we moved, and of course, part of that move means that everything is everywhere, including cacti! Cobe has decided to adopt the cacti now as his own, giving them names and faithfully never leaving them alone. I feel as if, this kind of activity shows his imaginary play in a way that also displays his attachment to things and people within his world.\n\nIt's wonderful to see him get attached to these little things in a way that puts his role in life into a more of a carer where he feels like he has some ownership over something or someone who needs his care. With a baby brither or sister along the way, I'm encourages as to how he's going to look after them when they arrive with his ever growing soft and caring nature."
