This appears to be a natural skill of which is lost with age so we have been looking for ways to teach him a second language while to going is good.\n\nJac has managed to find the BBC's Muzzy app. Muzzy is a spanish cartoon that aims to teach non native spanish speakers spanish by simply watching cartoons that target the Spanish language in a layered way. The format is fun and comprises of entirely Spanish. Even I can follow along which is great so I can keep up with Cobe!\n\nTonight Cobe managed to say his first ever Spanish phrase 'Buenos Noches' inspired by Muzzy's Norman! Thanks Norman"
