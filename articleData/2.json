    "detail": "This afternoon, after meeting friends at the Whitworth gallery, we decided to take a trip over to The Manchester Museum. We'd never been before, although we had recently been told it was well worth the trip by a coworker of mine.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were bowled over by the displays, especially in the Jurassic room. Cobe loved running around looking at the massive dinosaur remains and models but marvelled at the size of T-Rex that stood formidably in the middle of the lobby. After a the humbling experience of standing next to such a giant, we took off to the next floor where we looked at a range of displays from native animals to Pompeii bodies. \n\nSoon we found ourselves in the reptile centre. Cobe has been reading 'Oi Frog' recently and was rather taken by the tiny frogs that live there.\n\nWe'll definitely take another trip out to the Manchester Museum in the not too distant future, there's plenty of artifacts that can be related to books read by Cobe at home to make the stories that little bit more real."
