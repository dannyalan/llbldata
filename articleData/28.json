    "detail": "Today, a new swedish kneeling chair arrived for my office at home. As always, Cobe was intrigued as to what the package was that came through the door.\n\nAs soon as we had ripped the box up and he had found that it was a chair, it wasn't long before he was reaching for the tools to lend a hand.\n\nCobe's job was to put the screws into the chair and start twisling them. He did a great job and left all of the screws in a state for me to just tighten up.\n\nThe only issue; getting him off the chair so I could carry on with muy work!\n\nCobe naturally wants to get involved and I'm really chuffed at the fact that we always find something challenging for him to take on with each job."
