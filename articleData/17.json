    "detail": "For Christmas, Cobe's uncle John decided to get Cobe and I a balloon modelling kit. It turned out that it was the source of great fun and creativity between us for many an evening. So much so that I decided to pick up a book, extra balloons and a brand new pump that was easier for him to operate.\n\nSince then, Cobe has taken to blowing up all of our balloons ready to model. I've even started him on his first few twists."
