    "detail": "Whilst we were away at the end of August, Cobe took his first hill trek up to the top of the highest point on the Isle of Iona in Scotland. It was a monumentous 100 meters above sea level and a massive triumph for the mini guy!\n\nToday, after seeing just how much he loved trekking up unaided, we decided to take him for a trip to Raven Stones overlooking Aldermans Hill and Dovestones reservoir in the Dark Peak. The route we took was steep but certainly walkable with a wide path and no obvious obstacles to get in Cobe's way.\n\nAlong the way, many a group of trekkers on the way down commented on how he was looking like he had a mission to complete! He even managed to overtake a gentleman along the way.\n\nCobe managed to get about half way up today and we managed to take this awesome shot of his hill walking personal best. You can just see how far down the reservoir really is.\n\nNot long and he'll definitely be at the top."
