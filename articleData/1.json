    "detail": "Today we sped off to RSPB Bempton Cliffs to go learn how different seabirds live together beside the ocean. The seabirds I was most interested in from what Mum and Dad had talked about was the Puffins. They are so colourful and beautiful.\n\nAlong the way, I learnt that prior preparation is always a good thing. I tend to learn that every time Mum and Dad take me out as we usually end up either running to the event or Dad puts his foot down on the motorway to avoid being late. They alway blame me for doing something or other.\n\nAnyway, we managed to make it on the boat and the RSPB volunteers were lovely and helpful. We set off and as soon as we left we found couple of Kittiewaits (they look like seagulls with pretty markings) on the harbour wall. The team at the RSPB explained that they are brave for sitting there in spite of the waves crashing against the wall.\n\nOnce we were out of the harbour we found many different birds but eventually we found a Puffin. They are tiny and move like the clappers! Mum and Dad managed to see them with the binoculars but I'm still a little too young for them.\n\nFurther out, we found Dad's favourite; the Gannets. They are thousands of them roosting on the cliffs. Once they realised we had Mackerel they were down like a shot. All diving into the water from high high above to get the fish thrown in by the volunteers. What an amazing display. Glad I can eat my fish at the dinner table though. I must admit, I'd probably belly flop trying to do what they do.\n\nWhat I learnt the most today is that being outdoors with my parents is the best. I can't wait to do something like this again."
