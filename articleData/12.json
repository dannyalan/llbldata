    "detail": "So we've been in our new house now for little over a fortnight and we are as every family does, doing what we can to get the house sorted. Tonight was my job to get Cobe's bed up. So I took myself off to put up the frame but soon enough Cobe wanted to be involved in the fun and make his bed up too.\n\nWatching how he approached the task, it was great to see how he just needed to be guided with what to do and soon enough, he's putting dowel joints in and screwing in panels himself!\n\nI guess once upon a time, I would've seen a child's involvement in a task like this that I needed to get completed was somewhat of a hinderance, but actually, the more I simply let him get on with it, the more he learns, the more he feels self confident about his capability to approach and complete a task and we both had a tonne of fun!\n\nHome learning is great fun, even in the little things like this."
