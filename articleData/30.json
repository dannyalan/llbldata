    "detail": "I popped through to the play room today to find Jac and Cobes sat with a tonne of pompoms.\n\nCobe had taken the lead of play time and with my tea strainer (of which he'd grabbed from the kitchen) he was seperating out each of the pompoms into a felt bowl that was of the corresponding colour.\n\nWe've noticed over time that Cobe is quite analytical. He watches everything and manages to always find order in pretty much everything he sees.\n\nIt's always encouraging watching him take the lead with play, he's always really engaged and it's great to see Jac enjoy it with him"
