    "detail": "Cobe decided he wanted to give me a hand today in stripping the wallpaper in my office. He's really great at getting involved in projects and sticking at them. I find it really interesting how Cobe always sticks out a job and truly gets in to it. It's almost like he already experiences 'flow' or 'getting in the zone' and seems to apply himself to a job he's committed to. In my experience most children start projects but then soon become bored and decide to drop it like a stone after a few minutes.\n\nIt's not the first time he's decided to take the makeshift putty knife to the walls and start removing the wallpaper ready for the new paint to go up.\n\nI'm sure when we do start painting he'll be involved in that too!."
