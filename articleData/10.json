    "detail": "Recently I spotted on social media a video that promoted a product that grew avacados from the stone.\n\nIt was a really simple dish that merely placed the stone in the dish with the bottom sat down in a pool, of shallow water. I decided once Jac had finished preparing Avacado for a dinner that I would get Cobe involved in giving it a go with three Bamboo skewers and a shallow cup to create the same effect.\n\nCobe stuck the skewers into the stone and we've placed the stone on the windowsill.\n\nAparently in time, they even bear their own Avacados! We'll have to see."
