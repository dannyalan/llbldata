    "detail": "Today was a Dad and Cobe day, and such a day will always mean being outside! With it being such a great day we took off from Manchester and visited the Trough of Bowland near Preston, Lancs. There was waiting the Wild Boar Park with a range of animals to see and learn about. Here Cobe checked out all of the Cows and Ponies as well as Llamas but sat down to hold a Chick. The lady who attended to us commented on how gentle Cobe was being with this day old animal sat clutched in his hands. Maybe having the neighbours cat; Flo around regularly has taught him a thing or two about handling and respecting animals.\n\nWe then left the animal pens to go check out some Meerkats. Once we were there Cobe was playing 'Match' with the Meerkats through the viewing window and the sculpture of the Meerkat to the side. Soon enough we took a trip out to go see the Geese, Sheep, Red Deer and Buffalo. Then, after falling in the mud and needing a new pair of trousers it was time to take the trek around the park to go see the Wild Boar in their massive enclosure. When we arrived, I was tickled to see that Cobe appears to be engaging with his sense of humour. From the Viewing platform you had to watch to spot the Boar, although Cobe had well and truly spotted them despite him cheekily saying that he couldn't see him! \n\nSoon enough it was time to depart from the park to go pick up Cobe's brother and sister Seb and Lula but it was great to see the animals, we'll certainly come back another time"
