    "detail": "After a number of days (5 to be exact) of hard labour, watering and checking our carrots, Cobe has this morning found the first carrot has sprouted!\n\nProud as punch shouting at me from across the house as if there was an utter emergency, I was summoned to the front room windowsill to find the fruits of this little lad's labour sat for all to see.\n\nYou can see just how happy he is from his picture at his first vegetable growing.\n\nGreat work Cobes, I'm looking forward to the cactus seeds arriving soon so we can sow those too."
