    "detail": "So this weekend was my birthday weekend and to treat me to something that not just I but the whole family would enjoy, Jacqueline kindly looked into a surprise day out for the family over in Birmingham. She had managed to find a family woodland festival where there was everything eco being celebrated. One of the stalls appeared particularly interesting to Cobe (and Seb; although he wouldn't admit it). This was the Birmingham Trees for Life stall - www.btfl.org.uk . This stall has everything a young one could wish for, chocolate and dirt.\n\nEven though, as a combination confectionary and a bucket of soil aren't palatable together; or maybe even at all, both boys decided to roll their sleeves up and get messy in the dirt.\n\nThe lady at the stall began to explain to us all that most trees that are planted are sadly vandalised and that BTFL are a charity that seeks to fix that, a worthy and noble cause. We all learnt about creating newspaper pots using a paper potter and once we had all created our pots, we decided to dig in and fill them with soil.\n\nA small acorn was added to each, knowing that once planted, BTFL would take great care of them and plant them appropriately to ensure they grow into great bug oak trees for future generations to enjoy.\n\nThanks Jac for our beautiful day out, hopefully we get to go back again next year too.\n\nGet involved, sponsor a tree with the BTFL"
