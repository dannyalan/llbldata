    "detail": "After much deliberation and research into the pros and cons of 'Letter of the Week', we have decided to give it a go in our learning journey with Cobe.\n\nSo what we're trying to achieve is not the opportunity for Cobe to learn the alphabet in simply 26 weeks, but instead, the chance to highlight and talk up different letters and their relationships with words.\n\nEvery day he astounds me with his breadth of vocabulary, there just always seems to be yet another word he knows about that knocks my socks off. What better an opportunity than to have a letter that plays the role of guest for the week where we can simply and naturally find where it lives in every day life. We'll be sure to post up our findings as time goes on!"
