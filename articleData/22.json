Things that you make a mental note of, such as, must clean that and, not too sure why they did that.\n\nToday, Cobe has decided to action his thoughts on the matter. He's been thinking that the door has been in need of a hoover.\n\nGlad he's got that off his chest, now we have a lovely clean door in the kitchen."
