    "detail": "So in Cobe's new playroom we have put up a tipi for him to play in. As it turns out, it's enough space for both Cobe and I (which much squeezing from me) to get in together.\n\nTurns out, he rather likes it as a quiet space for reading books. It's pretty cool how he decides on where he likes to base his activities but I'd probably say it's a rather good choice, quiet and tucked away so he can get into those stories"
