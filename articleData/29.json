    "detail": "We're still under lockdown and this evening I had the pleasure of taking this young man out for our once daily trip outside to exercise.\n\nCobe trundled up and down the grand height of 90 meters and managed to cover a mile in distance. Along the way, Cobe spotted several busy busy Manchester Bees looking for flowers, caused 2 Grouse and a few Pheasants to jump and fly away and even found a group of Lapwings chasing each other tumbling in flight and chirping.\n\nCobe was fascinated at the sound of them asking what they were saying and commenting on them having fun chasing each other.\n\nCobe is always so observant and finds interesting things everywhere he goes. He's quite possibly one of the best walking partners to have; he makes you stop and look, just for a while"
