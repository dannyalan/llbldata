It's great to see him involved in the task and he really loves pointing out the bits of food in his dinner that he prepared.\n\nTonight we were making breaded fish and Cobe was preparing the breaded mix with flour and black pepper.\n\nI think he just got a little carried away with the flour, but as you can see, he's unphassed by it all is just making sure he has enough pepper!"
