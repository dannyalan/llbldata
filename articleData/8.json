    "detail": "Cobe is always one for getting involved. Be it making cakes, cookies, peeling carrots of simply washing up, he's always keen to roll up his sleeves and get going on the job at hand.\n\nI guess when I first seen him do this with his Gran, you could say, I was nervous. I guess I was worried that he could maybe take a tumble off the stool he was stood at, or slip on a wet and slippery side, or even, just fall in! But it didn't take me long to realise just what his Gran had led him towards. Once I realised what it was, I noticed it was something quite special.\n\nWhat Mary had encouraged him to do, was take risks. Not massive risks, nor risks that are petty and not worth taking, but instead, she taught him to get involved in jobs that would normally be for adults and instead of letting adults carry out the jobs, seek to get involved in activities without a fear of looking at a barrier to entry, i.e. height to the sink, nervous about doing it right, making a mess or whatever seems to go through a young boy's head about doing a job.\n\nThanks Mary for breaking down barriers and encouraging our youngest family member to grab things by the horns and be autonomous.\n\nHome learning at it's best, when you least expect it"
