    "detail": "Today we nipped over to Whitworth Park in Manchester to join a nature walk. Sadly, we arrived late and missed the walk, but we soon found out why the park was picked.\n\nNot before long, Cobe found a squirrel that was pretty inquisitive. He hopped over to Cobe and wanted to see if he had any food for him. The pair checked each other out for a little while before the Squirrel (quite rightly) though Cobe was getting a bit too close for comfort!\n\nIt's great getting him outside and seeing the wildlife that's even living in our cities."
