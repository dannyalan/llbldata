    "detail": "When Jac was pregnant with Coban, she decided to pick up a picnic table for him. Since then, we've been in smaller homes with smaller gardens and it has always been in storage.\n\nToday however, I managed to pick it up from the store and decided to get it all set up with Cobe. Jac grabbed his toy toolset to give me a hand but just as always, Cobe knew that he wanted to be involved in the realy tools and ensure that he was in on the action of actually making his new table.\n\nCobe's job was to firstly, help me separate all the different pieces into piles and then to start my screwing in screws into the sides of the table.\n\nHe did a grand job and again managed to get the screws through the trickily lined up bolt holes to join the two pieces together.\n\nSoon enough the table was up and he couldn't wait to give it a try.\n\nI can't help but feel that he appreciates things more when he's involved in it's making, or selection and feels like he's been part of the process."
