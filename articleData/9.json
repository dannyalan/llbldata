    "detail": "I bought Cobe an abacus a few months back. I was considering how I would be able to start explaining how numbers are structured in terms of units, tens, etc and decided that an abacus was a pretty good starting point.\n\nI didn't however consider that I would need to use this for quite some time, bearing in mind Cobe would need the ability to think in terms of cardinality and ordinality first, before I would need to start mentioning number bases and how they work.\n\nAs it turns out, the abacus has had a more immediate effect than I though. What it has actually started to do is allow him to play with numbers. Something that I hadn't considered when purchasing it. Cobe has somewhat taken to moving the beads and counting how many he moves up and down and is loves talking about the colours too.\n\nI'm always interested by how he sees things and gets involved naturally without me even needing to do anything to peak his interest."
